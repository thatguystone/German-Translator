	<h4>So...what?</h4>
	<p>
		What you're looking at is a tool to help you understand German.  First, you might ask yourself why you would only
		ever want the verbs of a sentence translated, but how often has it happened that you read an entire sentence, understand
		every word, then get to a verb and wonder what it's doing?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  This is for that case.

		So, as you're reading, you can use the bookmarklet provided to help you understand what's going on.

<div class="question">
	<h4>Why not Google Translator / Babel Fish?</h4>
	<p>
		Well, if you're looking for a new translator and actually found this, that answers that question.  Those translators
		will only help you so much before you just get lost in their nonsensicalilityness.  Plus, when those guys look
		at sentences, they often fail spectacularly at identifying verb tenses.  Verbinator is a tool to help you understand
		the verbs in sentences and what they're doing.

<div class="question">
	<h4>How accurate is all this? / I found something that's wrong!</h4>
	<p>
		This is actually pretty accurate -- for doing language processing, it does rather well for itself.  It's by no
		means 100% accurate in every case, but for a majority of German sentences, it will get the job done. 
	</p>
	<p>
		If you think that you found an error with the translation, chances are you did.  You see, natural language processing
		is incredibly difficult to get 100% right (if it were easy, this site would not exist).  So, the errors you're
		seeing most likely arise from the fact that there's some ambiguity in German that could not be resolved
		programatically, so it tried its best, but that wasn't good enough.  Not even the magic and dark magic that
		the site use are good enough for every case.
	</p>

<div class="question">
	<h4>What's with all the magic?</h4>
	<p>
		Buttons tend to need text, and I figured magic was a good way to describe it because, on the back end, there's
		quite a bit of processing and "magic" going on.  In reality, the magic is nothing more than intense processing
		and crunching of the sentence.

<div class="question">
	<h4>I want to learn your magic!</h4>
	<p>
		First of all, that's not a question.  Second of all, <a href="http://gitorious.org/nyu-german-translator" target="_blank">you can</a>!
