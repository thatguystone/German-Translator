<h1>Bookmarklet</h1>

<p>
	So you're thinking to yourself, "hey, that's actually kinda nifty, but man I would love to be able to use it on 
	other sites!"  My friend, your dream has come true, behold: the Verbinator Bookmarklet.
</p>

<p>
	For those who don't know, a bookmarklet is a little piece of code that you can store as a bookmark to give you added
	functionality on other sites.  In this case, if you install the bookmarklet, you will get the ability to get Verbinator
	translations on other pages.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
	To install the bookmarklet, here's what you do:
	<ol>
		<li>Make sure that you have your bookmarks bar enabled.</li>
		<li>Click and drag the button at the bottom of the page to you bookmarks bar.</li>
		<li>And it's installed!</li>
	</ol>
	
	If that didn't help, Google made a short video about how to install their Notebook bookmarklet.  The same concept 
	applies for the Verbinator Bookmarklet (except our bookmarklet is at the bottom of the page).

</p>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>
	Now that it's installed, let's take a look at how to use it.
</p>

<p>
	Say you're on some German site, reading through stuff, and you need some help.  For this example, we're going to use
	the Thomas Mann text, <i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12108" target="_blank">Der Tod in Venedig</a></i>.
	As your're going through the walls of text, you read something that we just need a bit of help on.  Here's what you do:
	<ol>
		<li>Activate the Verbinator bookmarklet you just installed (just click it!)</li>
		<li>Select the little segment of text that you want help on.</li>
		<li>Understand it.</li>
	</ol>
	
	In more concrete terms, here's what happens:
	<div class="centerImage">
		<img src="./images/bookmarklet.was.jpg" />
	</div>
	
	Maybe verbinator can help me! Let me highlight the text I need help on...and...!
	<div class="centerImage">
		<img src="./images/bookmarklet.answer.jpg" />
	</div>
	
	Awesome, well that makes more sense!
</p>

<h2>Misc. Notes</h2>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Presently, Verbinator only works with German.</li>
		<li>It can give you translations for single words, clauses, or sentences.</li>
		<li>Compound sentences sometimes give Verbinator trouble and hurt its magic.  Fair warning.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
